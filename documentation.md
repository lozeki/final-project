# Documentation
## Create the website with GitHub, Docker Cloud, and Amazon Web Services.

### Create the Project on local computer and push it to the remote repository on github

1. Create a new repository on GitHub without README, license, or gitignore files by click on the new button on repositories tab. 

2. Open Git Bash on your PC.

3. Create a folder on your PC for the project.

4. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
```
   $ git init
```
5. Create README.md file and add the file to your repository.
```
   $ echo "# final-project" >> README.md
   $ git add README.md
```
6. Commit it to your local repository.
```
   $ git commit -m "Create the repo for final project"
```
7. Connect your repository to github ( you can copy the remote repository URL from your github setup page).
```
   $ git remote add origin https://github.com/lozeki/final-project.git
```
8. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub (youâ€™ll have to type your github usename and password when you push to github).
```
   $ git push -u origin master
```
### Create the repository on Docker cloud and connect it with your repository on github

1. Create a new repository on Docker cloud and link it with your repository on github under Builds tab.

2. Configure automated builds for specific tags by click on Configure automated builds.

..* Build location - small
..* Autotest - Internal Pull Requests
..* Source type - Tag
..* Source - /^[0-9.]+$/
..* Docker Tag - release-{sourceref}

### Prepare Dockerfile, YAML files, an others to run the image.

#### They are using for configuration files, blueprints, and also in page settings. 

1. Build a Dockerfile to install the software we need on the server.

```
FROM ubuntu:xenial

# Location for copy all the files we need
COPY . /src

# The working location
WORKDIR /src

# Install requirement software
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y --assume-yes --no-install-recommends apt-utils 
RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install Werkzeug Jinja2 Flask
```
2. Use docker-compose.test.yml file to run our desire function(We only need the test function in this project).
```
sut:
    build: .
    command: ./run_tests.sh
```
3. Create the Test run_tests.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running Flask Unit Tests"
python3 final_web_test.py
```
4. Build the test function with control the test on the Flask webserver.
```
import unittest
import final_web

class FlaskrTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.app = final_web.app.test_client()
    def tearDown(self):
        pass
    def test_home_page(self):
        # Render the / path of the website
        rv = self.app.get('/')
        # Chech that the page contians the desired phrase
        assert b'Final Project Website' in rv.data 
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
``` 
5. Push your branch to your github, and start a pull request. The test will fail because we didn't write any code for final_web.py.

6. Build the The main program final_web.py which controls how the Flask website will run. Commit and push changes to the github branch. If the test passes, merge and submit a link to your pull request. If the test fails, redo it again. 
```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():

    return "Final Project Website"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0',port=5000)
```
### Ansible-playbooks: A simple and Powerful automation. We use it to buid an control the version of our images.
  
####Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

1. Copy the ansible folder to the repository.

2. Use git tags to control the version of the images.
```
# Set your most recent commit to your docker-cloud-test's master branch to 0.0.1.
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git tag 0.0.1

#Push your tags to github and verify through the UI that they exist.
git push --tags origin master
```
2. Connecting to the Remote Server with SSH-key.
..*Use the private ssh key to connect with the  AWS instance.

3. Clone your repository and run the ansible-playbooks:
```
ansible-playbook configure-host.yml -v --extra-vars "student_username=tnguyen"

ansible-playbook deploy-website-production.yml -v

ansible-playbook deploy-website-staging.yml -v
```
